## Classification 

a. Which of the following aspects of model building apply to classification models? (Choose all that apply)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer="specify",
    answer="fit",
    answer="accuracy", 
    answer="reliability"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

b. What is the difference between regression and classification? 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "answer"
#| eval: false
"Regression predicts a continuous response varaible, 
classification predicts a discrete response variable"

```

c. Which accuracy metric is best applied to classification models? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "R squared",
    "RMSE",
    answer ="Pecent correct",
    "All of the above"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

d. In the figure below, which aspect shows the response variable? 

![](/assests/images/pquiz4-3d.png)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "x-axis",
    "y-axis",
    answer ="color of points",
    "blue line"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

e. Which figure below could show a plotted classification model? Choose all that apply.

![](/assests/images/pquiz4-3e.png)


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer = "Figure A",
    answer = "Figure B",
    answer = "Figure C"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```


f. Name two kinds of linear classifiers

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "answer"
#| eval: false
"Any 2 of those mentioned in class: 
Logistic regression
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
Linear support vector machines (SVM)
Nearest-prototype classifiers
Naive Bayes classifiers
"

```


## 4 Classification in R 

a. We can impliment classification via `r mcq(c("linear regression", "cubic polynomials", answer =  "logistic regression", "nearest-neighbor regression", "all of the above"))`

b. True or false, in R, we can perform logistic regression with a generalized linear model. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(answer="True", "False")

cat(longmcq(choices))

```

c. What 3 elements do all GLMs have? 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "answer"
#| eval: false
"1. A particular distribution for modeling the response variable
2. A linear model 
3. A link function
"

```

d. What is the link function for logistic regression? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer = "logistic function", 
    "polynomial expansion",
    "log transformation",
    "inverse transformation"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))

```

f. Which of the following fits a logistic regression model in R? Choose one.


```r
# code A
glm(y ~ x, data = data, family = "binomial")

# code B
data %>%
    specify(y ~ x) %>%
    fit() 

# code C 
logistic_reg %>%
    set_engine("glm") %>%
    fit(y ~ x, data = data)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "code A", 
    "code B",
    "code C",
    "code A and B only",
    answer = "all of the above"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))

```

    "text": "Course description: Data Sci for Lang & Mind is an entry-level course designed to teach basic principles of statistics and data science to students with little or no background in statistics or computer science. Students will learn to identify patterns in data using visualizations and descriptive statistics; make predictions from data using machine learning and optimization; and quantify the certainty of their predictions using statistical models. This course aims to help students build a foundation of critical thinking and computational skills that will allow them to work with data in all fields related to the study of the mind (e.g. linguistics, psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, neuroscience).\nPrerequisites: There are no prerequisites beyond high school algebra. No prior programming or statistics experience is necessary, though you will still enjoy this course if you already have a little. Students who have taken several computer science or statistics classes should look for a more advanced course.\nProfessor: Dr. Katie Schuler (likes to be called Katie). I really enjoy getting to know students outside of class. Here are a few ways to connect with me:\n\nOffice Hours: Day/Time TBD, 3401-C Walnut, 314C.

If you collaborate on psets, you need to write your own code/solutions, name your collaborators, and cite any outside sources you consulted (you don’t need to cite the course material).\nAccomodations: We will fully support any accommodations arranged through Disability Services via the Weingarten Center. If class conflicts with a religious holiday you observe, we are happy to make alternate arrangements. Please let us know early in either case so we can plan ahead.\nExtra credit: There is no extra credit in the course. However, students can submit any missed problem set or exam by the end of the semester for half credit (50%) to boost their grade.\nRegrade requests Regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope within one week of receiving your graded assignment. Please explain why you believe there was a grading mistake, given the posted solutions and rubric",

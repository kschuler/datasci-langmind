    "section": "Basics",
    "text": "Basics\nWe begin by defining some basic concepts:\n\nExpressions are combinations of values, variables, operators, and functions that can be evaluated to produce a result. Expressions can be as simple as a single value or more complex involving calculations, comparisons, and function calls. They are the fundamental building blocks of programming.\n\n10 - a simple value expression that evaluates to 10.\nx &lt;- 10 - an expression that assigns the value of 10 to x.\nx + 10 - an expression that adds the value of x to 10.\na &lt;- x + 10 - an expression that adds the value of x to 10 and assigns the result to the variable a\n\nObjects allow us to store various types of data, such as numbers, text, vectors, matrices; and more complex structures like functions and data frames. Objects are created by assigning values to variable names with the assignment operator, &lt;-. For example, in x &lt;- 10, x is an object assigned to the value 10.\nNames that we assign to objects must include only letters, numbers, ., or _. Names must start with a letter (or . if not followed by a number).\nAttributes allow you to attach arbitrary metadata to an object. For example, adding a dim (dimension) attribute to a vector allows it to behave like a matrix or n dimensional array.\nFunctions (or commands) are reusable pieces of code that take some input, preform some task or computation, and return an output. Many functions are built-in to base R (see below!), others can be part of packages or even defined by you. Functions are objects!\nEnvironment is the collection of all the objects (functions, variables etc.) we defined in the current R session.\nPackages are collections of functions, data, and documentation bundled together in R. They enhance R’s capabilities by introducing new functions and specialized data structures. Packages need to be installed and loaded before you can use their functions or data.\nComments are notes you leave to yourself (within code blocks in colab) to document your code; comments are not evaluated.\nMessages are notes R leaves for you, after you run your code. Messages can be simply for-your-information, warnings that something unexpected might happen, or erros if R cannot evaluate your code.\n\nWays to get help when coding in R:\n\nRead package docs - packages usually come with extensive documentation and examples. Reading the docs is one of the best ways to figure things out. Here is an example from the dplyr package.\nRead error messages - read any error messages you receive while coding — they give clues about what is going wrong!\nAsk R - Use R’s built-in functions to get help as you code\nAsk on Ed - ask questions on our class discussion board!\nAsk Google or Stack Overflow - It is a normal and important skill (not cheating) to google things while coding and learning to code! Use keywords and package names to ensure your solutions are course-relevant.\nAsk ChatGPT - You can similarly use ChatGPT or other LLMs as a resource. But keep in mind they may provide a solution that is wrong or not relevant to what we are learning in this course."

While str() shows you all the pieces of any object (its structure), subsetting allows you to pull out the pieces that you’re interested in. ~ Hadley Wickham, Advanced R\n\nThere are three operators for subsetting objects:\n\n[ - subsets (one or more) elements\n[[ and $ - extracts a single element\n\nThere are six ways to subset multiple elements from vectors with [:\n\nx[c(1,2)] - positive integers select elements at specified indexes\nx[-c(1,2)] - negative integers select all but elements at specified indexes\nx[c(\"name\", \"name2\")] select elements by name, if elements are named\nx[] - nothing returns the original object\nx[0] - zero returns a zero-length vector\nx[c(TRUE, TRUE)] - select elements where corresponding logical value is TRUE\n\nThese also apply when selecting multiple elements from higher dimensional objects (matrix, array, data frame), but note that:\n\nindexes for different dimensions are separated by commas [rows, columns, ...]\nomitted dimensions return all values along that dimension\nthe result is simplified to the lowest possible dimensions by default\ndata frames can also be indexed like a vector (selects columns)\n\nThere are 3 ways to extract a single element from any data structure:\n\n[[2]] - a single positive integer (index)\n[['name']] - a single string\nx$name - the $ operator is a useful shorthand for [['name']]\n\nWhen extracting single elements, note that:\n\n[[ is preferred for atomic vectors for clarity (though[ also works)\n$ does partial matching without warning; use options(warnPartialMatchDollar=TRUE)\nthe behavior for invalid indexes is inconsistent: sometimes you’ll get an error message, and sometimes it will return NULL"

This course aims to help students build a foundation of critical thinking and computational skills that will allow them to work with data in all fields related to the study of the mind (e.g. linguistics, psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, neuroscience).\nPrerequisites: There are no prerequisites beyond high school algebra. No prior programming or statistics experience is necessary, though you will still enjoy this course if you already have a little. Students who have taken several computer science or statistics classes should look for a more advanced course.\nProfessor: Dr. Katie Schuler (likes to be called Katie). I really enjoy getting to know students outside of class. Here are a few ways to connect with me:\n\nOffice Hours: Day/Time TBD, 3401-C Walnut, 314C. Drop in for questions/ideas or just to chat.\nSnack & Share: Join me weekdays at 1:30pm in the Linguistics Library (15 min free snack break)\n\nTAs:\n\nBrittany Zykoski\nMingyang Bian\nIzabela Baran\n\nLectures: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12 - 1:29pm in COHN 402.\nLabs: Hands-on practice and exam prep guided by TAs.\n\n402: Fri at 3:30-4:29p in WILL 316 with Brittany\n403: Thu at 1:45-2:44p in WILL 204 with Brittany\n405: Fri at 12:00-12:59p in WILL 321 with Mingyang (and Izabela)\n406: Thu at 5:15-6:14p in BENN 322 with Mingyang (and Izabela)\n\nOffice Hours: You are welcome to attend any office hours that fit your schedule. The linguistics department is located on the 3rd floor of 3401-C Walnut street, between Franklin’s Table and Modern Eye.\n\nKatie Schuler: TBD in 314C\nBrittany Zykoski: TBD\nMingyang Bian: Thursdays 10:30-11:30 in 325C.\n\nGrading:\n\n20% Homework (equally weighted, lowest dropped)\n20% Lab Attendance/Participation (up to 2 absences excused without penalty)\n60% Exams (equally weighted, final is optional to replace lowest exam)\n\nCollaboration: Collaboration on problem sets and labs is highly encouraged! If you collaborate on psets, you need to write your own code/solutions, name your collaborators, and cite any outside sources you consulted (you don’t need to cite the course material).\nAccomodations: We will fully support any accommodations arranged through Disability Services via the Weingarten Center. If class conflicts with a religious holiday you observe, we are happy to make alternate arrangements. Please let us know early in either case so we can plan ahead.\nExtra credit: There is no extra credit in the course. However, students can submit any missed problem set or exam by the end of the semester for half credit (50%) to boost their grade.\nRegrade requests Regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope within one week of receiving your graded assignment. Please explain why you believe there was a grading mistake, given the posted solutions and rubric",

This course aims to help students build a foundation of critical thinking and computational skills that will allow them to work with data in all fields related to the study of the mind (e.g. linguistics, psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, neuroscience).\nPrerequisites: There are no prerequisites beyond high school algebra. No prior programming or statistics experience is necessary, though you will still enjoy this course if you already have a little. Students who have taken several computer science or statistics classes should look for a more advanced course.\nProfessor: Dr. Katie Schuler (likes to be called Katie). I really enjoy getting to know students outside of class. Here are a few ways to connect with me:\n\nOffice Hours: Day/Time TBD, 3401-C Walnut, 314C. Drop in for questions/ideas or just to chat.\nSnack & Share: Join me weekdays at 1:30pm in the Linguistics Library (15 min free snack break)\n\nTAs:\n\nBrittany Zykoski\nMingyang Bian\nIzabela Baran\n\nLectures: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12 - 1:29pm in COHN 402.\nLabs: Hands-on practice and exam prep guided by TAs.\n\n402: Fri at 3:30-4:29p in WILL 316 with Brittany\n403: Thu at 1:45-2:44p in WILL 204 with Brittany\n405: Fri at 12:00-12:59p in WILL 321 with Mingyang (and Izabela)\n406: Thu at 5:15-6:14p in BENN 322 with Mingyang (and Izabela)\n\nOffice Hours: You are welcome to attend any office hours that fit your schedule. The linguistics department is located on the 3rd floor of 3401-C Walnut street, between Franklin’s Table and Modern Eye.\n\nKatie Schuler: TBD in 314C\nBrittany Zykoski: TBD\nMingyang Bian: Thursdays 10:30-11:30 in 325C.\n\nGrading:\n\n20% Homework (equally weighted, lowest dropped)\n20% Lab Attendance/Participation (up to 2 absences excused without penalty)\n60% Exams (equally weighted, final is optional to replace lowest exam)\n\nCollaboration: Collaboration on problem sets and labs is highly encouraged! If you collaborate on psets, you need to write your own code/solutions, name your collaborators, and cite any outside sources you consulted (you don’t need to cite the course material).\nAccomodations: We will fully support any accommodations arranged through Disability Services via the Weingarten Center. If class conflicts with a religious holiday you observe, we are happy to make alternate arrangements. Please let us know early in either case so we can plan ahead.\nExtra credit: There is no extra credit in the course. However, students can submit any missed problem set or exam by the end of the semester for half credit (50%) to boost their grade.\nRegrade requests Regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope within one week of receiving your graded assignment. Please explain why you believe there was a grading mistake, given the posted solutions and rubric",

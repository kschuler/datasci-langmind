##  Conditions for inference

- Up until now, there is no math reason we can't fit a model (mostly)
- But when we start **interpreting** and **using statistical inference** we have to be more careful. We want to infer something about the population. 
- Certain conditions need to be met for the results of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals to have intepretable meanings. 

## What are the conditions? 

1. Linearity
2. Normality of residuals
3. Homogeneity of variance
4. Independence 

. . . 

We can check Linearity, Normality, and Equality with `check_model()`. But the independence condition can only be verified through an understanding of how the data was collected. 

## 1. Linearity {.smaller}

The relationship between the response and explantory variables must be linear. The model assumes that the response variable can be expressed as a linear combination (weighted sum of inputs). 

. . .

## Reminder: residuals  {.smaller}

## 2. Normality {.smaller}

The residuals should be a **normal distribution** centered at zero. 

. . . 

![](/assests/images/assume-normality.png)

. . . 

Important for hypothesis testing, because many theoretical distributions (t-test, F-test, etc) assume a normal distribution. 

## 3. Homogeneity of variance {.smaller}

The residuals should have **equal variance** across all values of the explanatory variables (homoscedasticity). The value/spread of residuals should not depend on the value of our explanatory variable. 

. . .

. . . 

Important because unequal variances can distort the standard errors of our parameter estimates (unreliable estimates of reliability!)


## 4. Independence 

The observations in our data must be independent. Important because this can inflate our test statistics


# Multilevel models 



## 🥸 Aliases of multilevel models 

- Mixed models
- Mixed effect models 
- Hierarchical models 
- Mixed effect regression
- Probably even more!

# Demo with `lexdec`

```r
library(languageR)
```

## Lexical decision data {.smaller}

```{r}
lexdec %>% glimpse
```

## Explore RT by Frequency {.smaller}

```{r}
ggplot(lexdec, aes(x = Frequency, y = RT)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Model RT by Frequency {.smaller}

```{r}
model <- lm(RT ~ Frequency, data = lexdec) 
summary(model)

```


## Plot the model {.smaller}

```{r}
ggplot(lexdec, aes(x = Frequency, y = RT)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## Check assumptions  {.smaller}

```{r}
check_model(model)
```

## Is independence violated? {.smaller}

```{r}
lexdec %>% 
  group_by(Subject) %>% 
  tally()
```

## Can we just add subject? {.smaller}

```{r}
model_subj <- lm(RT ~ Frequency + Subject, data = lexdec)
summary(model_subj)
```

Math says yes! But this is not a great idea. 

## The model specification {.smaller}

in R: 

```r
RT ~ Frequency + Subject
```

. . . 

in Eq:

\begin{align}
RT_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Frequency}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Subject}_2 + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Subject}_3 \\
 &+ \beta_4 \cdot \text{Subject}_4 + \beta_5 \cdot \text{Subject}_5 + \cdots + \beta_{21} \cdot \text{Subject}_{21} + \epsilon_i
\end{align}


## Solution: multilevel-model! {.smaller}

`lmer` instead of `lm` and include random intercepts 

```{r}
model_multi <- lmer(RT ~ Frequency + (1|Subject), data = lexdec)

```

. . . 

```{r}
summary(model_multi)
```

## Model specification {.smaller}

\begin{align}
RT_{ij} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Frequency}_i + u_j + \epsilon_{ij} 
\end{align}

In a fitted model:

- $\beta_0$ is overall intercept
- $\beta_1$ is the fixed effect of frequency on RT 
- $u_j$ is the  random intercept for subject $j$, representing the **individual deviation** for each subject from the overall mean RT. 

## Returning the random effects {.smaller}

We can get the value of $u_j$ for each subject with ranef. 

```{r}
# Get the random effects (u_j values)
ranef(model_multi)
```

## Plotting the model with predict {.smaller}

```{r}
lexdec_w_predict <- lexdec %>%
  mutate(prediction = predict(model_multi, lexdec)) %>%
  mutate(prediction_fixed = predict(model_multi, lexdec, re.form = NA)) %>%
  select(Subject, Word, Frequency, RT, prediction, prediction_fixed)

lexdec_w_predict %>% filter(Frequency == 4.859812)
```

## Plotting the model with predict {.smaller}

```{r}
lexdec_w_predict %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = RT)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Subject, y = prediction)) 
```

## Plotting the model with predict {.smaller}

```{r}
lexdec_w_predict %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = RT)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Subject, y = prediction)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = prediction_fixed), linewidth = 3, color = "blue")
```

## All of our usual stuff applies! 


```{r}
summary(model_multi)

```

- we can't use infer anymore, but all the rest!

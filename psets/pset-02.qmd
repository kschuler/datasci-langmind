# Warning: Avoid redundant loading 
You will need the `tidyverse` library. Recall that Colab comes with this library already installed, and `tidyverse` includes `tibble`, `readr`, and `ggplot`. Avoid redundant loading.

## Problem 1

Create the following tibble with the `tribble()` function (not `tibble()`). Use the `map()` function from the `purr` package to calculate the `median` of each column, and store it as `col_means`. Use the pipe operator (`%>%` or `|>`) to pipe that list into `as_tibble()`, so the output is formatted as tibble. Finally, use `rename()` to rename the columns of your new tibble to `mean_height`, `mean_weight`, and `mean_age`. Return or print the resulting tibble. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble(
  ~height, ~weight, ~age,
      150,      45,   18,
      160,      54,   21,
      165,      60,   25,
      170,      68,   30,
      175,      72,   34,
      180,      79,   40,
      185,      85,   50,
      190,      90,   60
)

```
## Problem 2

Download this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jGKbMEc6ovgcpSPt2OobWBPPPMryFBBx1YZMPwmUc64/edit?usp=sharing) as a CSV file and upload it into Colab. Then, use the appropriate function from the `readr` package to import your CSV file into R. Use the `na` argument to the function to make sure R can recognize the `NA` values in the `RT_ms` column. Also include the `col_types()` argument to the function to ensure the `is_frequent` column is logical and `RT_ms` is a double. Use `problems()` to return the problematic rows in the data. Repair the problems, then use the `rename()` function to ensure consistent naming in your columns (use `_` not spaces). 

<!-- ```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
tibble(
trial_id = 1:10,
target_word = c("apple", "violin", "doctor", "cactus", "butter",
                "galaxy", "window", "anchor", "garden", "banana"),
sentence_congruency = c("congruent", "incongruent", "congruent", "incongruent",
                        "congruent", "incongruent", "congruent", "incongruent",
                        "congruent", "incongruent"),
word_frequency = c("high", "low", "high", "low", "low",
                    "high", "high", "low", "low", "high"),
N400_uV = c(-2.1, -7.3, -2.4, -6.8, -3.6,
            -5.1, -2.7, -7.0, -3.4, -5.4),
RT_ms = c(520, 760, 535, 740, 590,
            690, 545, 755, 600, 700)
) %>% kable() 

``` -->

## Problem 3 

Sometimes the best way to learn a new package or function is to explore the documentation. The  `googlesheets4` package allows you to work with Google Sheets directly from R. Read the [documentation](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) for this package and figure out how to connect to a sheet, read its contents, and bring the data into R. Use `googlesheets4` to import the `Europe` tab of the gapminder sheet, available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit?gid=780868077#gid=780868077). Return or print the imported sheet to confirm it was read in correctly. You should see the following output.

```{r}
#| echo: false 

europe <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit#gid=780868077", sheet = "Europe")

europe %>% print()

```

## Problem 4

With `ggplot2` and the `europe` data you imported in problem 3, recreate (as faithfully as possible), the following histogram of life expectancy for countries in Europe. Make sure the bars of the histogram are light blue, the border around the bars are black, and you edit the x-axis label to match. Also make sure you have approximately the same number of bins in your histogram. 

```{r}
#| echo: false

europe %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = 'lightblue', color = 'black') +
    facet_wrap(~country) +
    labs(x = 'Life Expectancy')
```

5. Using the `english` dataset in the `languageR` library, recreate the following table. Convert the dataset to a tibble with `as_tibble()`, then chain together `dplyr` verbs with the `%>%` operator to create the columns in the order shown. Explore the `%in%`operator and use it with filter in order to filter to the specific words shown. Sort them in alphabetical order, as shown. Use mutate to create two new columns not in the original data: `RTnaming_mean` (mean of the RTnaming vector) and `RTnaming_diffmean` (subtract `RTnaming_mean` from `RTnaming`)

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(languageR)

small_english <- english %>%
    as_tibble() %>% 
    select(Word, WordCategory, 
    AgeSubject, LengthInLetters, RTnaming) %>%
    filter(Word %in% c('moose', 'queen', 'owl', 'pup', 'breeze' )) %>%
    arrange(Word) %>%
    mutate(
        RTnaming_mean = mean(RTnaming), 
        RTnaming_meandiff = RTnaming - RTnaming_mean
        ) 
        
small_english %>% kable


```

6. Take the resulting tibble from question 5, group the data by `AgeSubject` with `group_by()` and `summarise()` by computing the mean and standard deviation of`RTnaming_diffmean`. Return the summarized tibble or print it (as shown). Then use the summarized data to recreate the figure. Figure out how to remove the legend entirely!

```{r}
#| echo: false

group_english <- small_english %>%
    group_by(AgeSubject) %>%
    summarise( mean = mean(RTnaming_meandiff), sd = sd(RTnaming_meandiff)) 
    
group_english %>% kable

group_english %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = AgeSubject, y = mean, fill = AgeSubject)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    theme_classic(base_size = 15) +
    labs(fill = "") +
    theme(legend.position = "none")


```

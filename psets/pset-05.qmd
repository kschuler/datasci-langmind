## Instructions

Upload your `.ipynb` notebook to **Gradescope** by **11:59 AM (noon)** on the due date. At the top of your notebook, include your **name**, **problem set number**, and any **collaborators**. Please include comments in your code to indicate which problem you are working on.

This problem set focuses on **model specification** — writing equations and model formulas that express relationships between variables.

## Problem 1 

Suppose you are studying songbird brains. You measured neuron density in regions involved in song learning for both **juvenile** and **adult** birds. Your dataset, [songbird_neurons.csv](/assests/csv/songbird_neurons.csv), includes an identifier for each subject, an age group (`juvenile` or `adult`), a brain region (`HVC`, `RA`, or `Area X`), the number of neurons per cubic millimeter, and the total number of distinct syllables in each bird’s song.

Your first question is about development: *How might you express a model that predicts neuron density as a function of age group?*  Express your model symbolically using LaTeX notation, and then write the same model using R’s formula syntax.  Briefly explain what each term represents in your model.

---

## Problem 2 

Your next question concerns the relationship between brain structure and behavior. You wonder whether birds with denser neural circuits produce more complex songs.  How could you specify a model that expresses **Song_Complexity** as a function of **Neuron_Density**?  Write the model first as a LaTeX equation, then as an R formula.  Describe what the intercept and slope represent in this context.

---

## Problem 3 

The dataset includes several potential explanatory variables for neuron density: **Brain_Region**, **Song_Complexity**, and **Age_Group**.  Suppose you want to model neuron density as a weighted combination of these variables.  Write down a linear model that includes all of them.  Then consider whether any of these predictors might be redundant or uninformative, and propose a simpler model that balances parsimony and interpretability.  Express both models in LaTeX and in R formula syntax, and explain why you might prefer the simpler one.

## Problem 4 

Imagine you are studying plant growth under different light conditions. In your dataset, [polynomial_plants.csv](/assests/csv/polynomial_plants.csv), you have measured **Plant_Height** and **Light_Exposure** across different plant species.  You suspect that the relationship between light and height might be nonlinear.  Write three models expressing plant height as a function of light exposure: a linear, a quadratic, and a cubic polynomial.  Represent each as a mathematical equation (for example, $y = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2$), and then as an R formula (for example, `Plant_Height ~ Light_Exposure + I(Light_Exposure^2) + I(Light_Exposure^3)`).  Explain what adding higher-order terms allows the model to capture.

---

## Problem 5 

Finally, return to the familiar dataset [animal_brain_body_size.csv](/assests/csv/animal_brain_body_size.csv).  You want to model **Brain_Size** as a function of **Body_Size**.  Write one model using the raw variables and another using log-transformed variables.  Present each as a mathematical equation and as an R formula.  Explain why a log transformation might be appropriate for comparing brain and body size across species.

## Challenge (optional)

In Problem 3, you considered several predictors of neuron density.  Suppose you now suspect that the effect of age group depends on brain region — that is, the two variables interact.  How could you express this relationship using an interaction term?  Write the model both in LaTeX and in R formula notation, and briefly describe what kind of relationship such an interaction term represents.
